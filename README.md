# fccCoin Blockchain, written in C++
My interest in cryptocurrency has been renewed lately, in part by the price of Dogecoin suddenly exploding and making my 81 Dogecoin equivalent to $31.00 USD.

Anyway, this got me looking into Blockchain technology and curious about how to write a basic implementation of one. Could I do it?


## Update 22 April, 2021 - IT WORKS
Finally, after two days of nonstop coding, I've successfully recreated the output of the original article (I took liberties with the Block format of course):
![I was ecstatic when the correct hash was found.](https://i.imgur.com/2ZW3VtC.png)

Now I need to go back and investigate my implementation of CTime, as well as a better indication that the mining is taking place instead of just throwing an insane amount of hashes at the screen before coming to an abrupt stop.
